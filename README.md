# System Monitor Plasmoid

A sleek and elegant plasmoid for at-a-glance system monitoring on KDE Plasma. Keep an eye on your system's vital signs without sacrificing panel space.

> [!NOTE]
> This plasmoid is inspired by the system monitor widget in GNOME, aiming to bring a similar clean and minimalist design to the KDE Plasma desktop.
